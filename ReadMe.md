#### Purpose of this Project
    The method to this maddness is to get me more comfortable  and familiar with JavaScript coding. I feel that this is helping even if my pace is slow. With more practice and projects I feel that I will become more efficient at it. 

##### Description
    The way this game is played is that you have two players with equal amount of cards in the begining. Each player will draw a card **ONLY** from the top of their deck. Once the card is played whoever has the highest card wins the round and will put both cards at the bottom of their deck. In case of a tie no one wins and the cards played will go back to each player. The game will continue untill one of the players collects all 52 cards.

###### What I Have Learned
    I learned that JavaScrpt is a cruel mistress. My understanding of it is not where I want it to be. Methods and functions might be simalr but they operate very differently. One simple synthax error or incorrect placing will screw up your code. I hope to improve how I think and plan to start the proper codes. I find myself struggle to start or which line of code to use. I need to improve how I start my projects especially when I don't have a reference or starter code to guide me. I hope you enjoy what I have stumbled to create.
